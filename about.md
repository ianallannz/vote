## Why me?

At 48, my heart’s on my sleeve and my head’s screwed on. 

This isn’t about a single issue; it’s about a new abundance built on place, not things. 

A place where richness comes from local pride, time outdoors, helping each other, and energising work in useful industries. An insulated place that’s worth staying in and returning to. 

Born and raised here by proud parents Derek and Moira-Jean, I'm rooted in compassion, sacrifice, and hard work. My early working years were alongside teachers, shaping my politics for fairness, care, and high expectations. 

Then a long intense private-sector career developed, solving hard problems in tough corners of the world with loyalty, strategic thinking, and commercial acumen. 

Some years ago we returned to Gisborne with our (now) three children where I've been guiding adult learners and advocating for strong regional higher education.
