## Heart on sleeve, head screwed on

> We should **vote for values** eh? Because, try as we might, you just don't know every decision we're asked to make.

**If you can see how the values in my story take us in the right direction, please give one of your votes to me, Ian Allan.**

### Enthusiasm with lived experience

At 48, I bring the right balance of enthusiasm and lived experience.

With a storied professional career, I now sit between three young children (10, 7, and 2) and elderly parents. 

My decision-making is for our rangatahi, to give peace-of-mind to our elderly.


### Compassion, sacrifice, hard work

Born and raised here by proud parents Derek and Moira-Jean, I'm rooted in compassion, sacrifice, and hard work. 

If watching my father run J.S. Allan's didn't instil it, maybe it was us just doing things that needed doing for others; from stocking 'copters during Bola, stacking wood, reflecting in church, fixing instead of replacing, to representing ol' Poverty Bay.

### Fairness, care, high expectations 

After a bloody hard degree in computing and mathematical science, my early working years were alongside teachers, shaping my politics for fairness, care, and high expectations. 

Then a long intense private-sector career developed, solving hard problems in tough corners of the world with loyalty, strategic thinking, and commercial acumen. 

Some years ago we returned to Gisborne with our (now) three children where I've been guiding adult learners and advocating for strong regional higher education.
