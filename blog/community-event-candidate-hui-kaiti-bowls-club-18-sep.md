## I will be attending the Community Hui at Kaiti Bowls Club on 18 September

In support of Tania Rauna &mdash; the TairƒÅwhiti Unicorn &mdash; and the activations she has encouraged, I'll be attending this hui to listen, observe, and share my thoughts with those interested in hearing more from me.

**Thursday 18 September, 6pm-8pm, Kaiti Bowls Club.**
