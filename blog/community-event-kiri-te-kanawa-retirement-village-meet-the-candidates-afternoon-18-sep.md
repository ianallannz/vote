## I will be attending the Kiri Te Kanawa Retirement Village Meet the Candidates Afternoon on 18 September

For residents of the Kiri Te Kanawa Retirement Village Independent and Serviced Apartments, this is a wonderful chance to hear from me and then about my history in Gisborne and far flung corners of the world!

**Thursday 18 September, 3pm, brief introductions followed by a Happy Hour Mingle, nice!**
