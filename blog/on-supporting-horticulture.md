## I was asked a few questions from the Tairāwhiti Growers Association 

>Tairāwhiti growers "expect councillors to understand the challenges we face, support practical solutions, work alongside and advocate for us to enable the sector to thrive."

Apart from student summer jobs, I don't have a background in horticulture and don't pretend to be an expert. 

So I take the approach I've taken throughout my career: talk to the people in the weeds, take on the advice of the key stakeholders, defer to experts and the experienced, and form pragmatic positions.

It's to ***fall in love with the problem, not the solution***. Or put another way: <a href="https://halfbanana.medium.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-paradox-unpacked-6201fffe797e" target="_blank">stubborn goals, flexible methods</a>&#8599;.

### Enabling a thriving horticulture sector in Tairāwhiti

As mentioned, I don't have a background in horticulture, but I have had a fruitful career in high- and low-tech hardware and software solutions in incredibly challenging markets. 

It will be technology solutions &mdash; that cleverly and pragmatically address our needs &mdash; that shift us up the value chain. An ideal scenario becomes home-grown horticultural technology &mdash; proven on our fields &mdash; that is productised and exported at high margins.

However, right now **we are short of visible pathways from secondary to vocational education to high-skilled work in our local industries**. As a Councillor I will use this background to support a locally-focused, joined-up strategy for STEAM education connected to useful work here. 

### The most pressing challenges facing horticultural growers now and into the future

The **costs of inputs and more volatile weather** are what I see as the most pressing challenges. I also see challenges **attracting and retaining highly-skilled workers**. 

With NZ's weak energy market, the cost of energy is increasing at an unreasonable rate. Supported by Council, our regional wealth holders need to continue to invest in energy self-sufficiency. While businesses themselves will need to continue a shift to electrification.

Attracting and retaining highly-skilled workers is harder and will take longer to address. Some of this goes back to my thoughts on education-to-work pathways. But for attracting the already-highly-skilled to the region, it is a problem of incomes and relative housing affordability associated with the poor supply of housing. 

**New Zealand's residential property-oriented political economy is a root-cause problem**. I have to believe we can break free from this stifling model at a regional level with Council playing a role as an efficient enabler of increased supply of all housing types. It has worked in other regions.

**Real regional wealth can only come from our high-productivity export businesses**, and that requires a steady supply of affordable housing and talented people that can see a good useful life out here.

### The importance of irrigation water security to our region’s growers and how to ensure a reliable, cost-effective irrigation water supply into the future

Incredibly important. Though this isn't an area where I have enough understanding to form a strong opinion as yet. So as I do, I'll go all-in to understand the problem by taking on the advice of the key stakeholders, experts, and fellow councillors who have this experience. 

>**Broadly my goal is to press Council to be a conscientious enabler, with an increased risk appetite, while ensuring negative externalities are not passed on to the public.**
