## For when you only have 1 minute 

Hi there, <a href="/about" title="About Me page">I'm Ian Allan</a>, son of Derek and Moira-Jean.

I'm here to imagine <a href="/#whatamithinking" title="The full What am I thinking page">a new abundance, built on place, not things</a>.

Because the broader context is we're in a system that's making our children poorer, and our grandchildren poorer still. On top of that our government's are getting poorer too.

Now that's a bleak reality, but I can see hope in us. 

I believe through our council and our regional wealth holders we can blunt the hard edges here by:

1. Restoring pride of place
2. Making this a place worth staying in, a place worth returning to
3. Becoming a deeply self-sufficient and resilient place

But to really understand how this raises disposable incomes and quality of life and where I've come from, you'll now need to look through:

- <a href="/">What am I thinking?</a>
- <a href="/about">Why me?</a>
- <a href="/blog">Diary</a> entries where I'm digging into the detail
- My council candidate video below
- <a href="https://policy.nz/2025/gisborne-district-council-tairawhiti-general-ward/policies/climate-change-and-resilience">Policy.nz</a>&#8599; for policy positions across a range of areas

And when it comes time to vote, don't think of me competing against your favourite candidates, think of me working *with* your favourite candidates, on your team.

Stronger together. Tātou tātou e.
