## When you vote, you need to rank us 

Hi! I'm standing as a candidate in the General Ward.

Maybe you landed here after scanning a QR code or googling ianallan.vote. And now you're wondering how do you vote exactly?

**<a href="https://vote.nz/enrolling/enrol-or-update/enrol-or-update-online/" target="_blank">Are you enrolled to vote? Are you sure?</a>**&#8599;

If you're enrolled to vote, in the next few days you'll receive a voting pack in your registered mail box &mdash; not your email box, your actual mail box &mdash; so look out for it. 

**You need to post your votes. If you don't know how to do that, ask someone who's old enough to remember posting letters.**

The Gisborne District Council has put together a useful video on how you vote and how it's all counted:

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnYUyDcrYUM?si=n9TMCSKwxZLCsZU9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

&nbsp;

It's pretty uncomfortable to say "I'm your number 1 candidate!" 

Most importantly, if you think I can help, please rank me on your General Ward team. 

**If you *really* think I can help, the best thing you can do is rank me higher than your other favourites, even number 1!**
