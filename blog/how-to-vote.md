## When you vote, you need to rank us 

Hi! I'm standing as a candidate in the General Ward.

Maybe you landed here after scanning a QR code or googling ianallan.vote. And now you're wondering how do you vote exactly?

**<a href="https://vote.nz/enrolling/enrol-or-update/enrol-or-update-online/" target="_blank">Are you enrolled to vote? Are you sure?</a>**&#8599;

If you're enrolled to vote, you should have now received a voting pack in your registered mail box &mdash; not your email box, your actual mail box. If you haven't received your voting pack by now, you can still cast a <a href="https://www.gdc.govt.nz/council/2025-elections/vote#heading-2" target="_blank">special vote</a>&#8599;.  

#### It's too late to post your vote! So... 

Drop your envelope in one of many **<a href="https://www.gdc.govt.nz/council/2025-elections/vote#heading-1" target="_blank">orange ballot box locations</a>**&#8599; provided by the council **before 12noon Saturday 11 October**.

The Gisborne District Council has put together a useful video on how you vote and how it's all counted:

</div>

It's pretty uncomfortable to say "I'm your number 1 candidate!" when there are many great candidates to make up your team. 

Most importantly, if you think I can help, please rank me on your General Ward team. 

**If you *really* think I can help, the best thing you can do is rank me higher than your other favourites, like number 1! If not, at least a number 2, or 3.**
