## On trying to steer clear of social media

<img src="../../images/bookmark.jpg" class="blog-float-img img-sm">Hopefully you'll see this little mail-drop from me over the next week or so.

I'm not holier-than-thou or judging those that are getting utility from social media, especially for supporting their businesses. 

But for me we've reached the point where, on-balance, the negatives of social media far outweigh its utility. 

The damage is visible everywhere, now proven by whistleblowers from inside these very companies. 

Even **the latest horrific tragedy with Charlie Kirk** almost certainly wouldn't have happened if we weren't all being pushed to extremes by social media. 

I found this recent commentary on **rage culture** useful: 

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbpsJARgd_o?si=lYNkgQZRQQqWzyrH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

I've felt this way for a long time now, it's not just the severe division it's creating, and the depression and anxiety and loneliness, but it's **the opportunity cost of all this needless distraction**. 

This video pitch from four years ago is still resonating:

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRb4q9XT_50?si=S5q57cbRUK_OqlEX" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

I hope to see you out there in the meatspace, face to face.
