        <h2 id="i-was-asked-a-few-questions-from-the-tair%C4%81whiti-growers-association" tabindex="-1">I was asked a few questions from the Tairāwhiti Growers Association</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Tairāwhiti growers &quot;expect councillors to understand the challenges we face, support practical solutions, work alongside and advocate for us to enable the sector to thrive.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from student summer jobs, I don't have a background in horticulture and don't pretend to be an expert.</p>
<p>So I take the approach I've taken throughout my career: talk to the people in the weeds, take on the advice of the key stakeholders, defer to experts and the experienced, and form pragmatic positions.</p>
<p>It's to <em><strong>fall in love with the problem, not the solution</strong></em>. Or put another way: <a href="https://halfbanana.medium.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-paradox-unpacked-6201fffe797e" target="_blank">stubborn goals, flexible methods</a>↗.</p>
<h3 id="enabling-a-thriving-horticulture-sector-in-tair%C4%81whiti" tabindex="-1">Enabling a thriving horticulture sector in Tairāwhiti</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I don't have a background in horticulture, but I have had a fruitful career in high- and low-tech hardware and software solutions in incredibly challenging markets.</p>
<p>It will be technology solutions — that cleverly and pragmatically address our needs — that shift us up the value chain. An ideal scenario becomes home-grown horticultural technology — proven on our fields — that is productised and exported at high margins.</p>
<p>However, right now <strong>we are short of visible pathways from secondary to vocational education to high-skilled work in our local industries</strong>. As a Councillor I will use this background to support a locally-focused, joined-up strategy for STEAM education connected to useful work here.</p>
<h3 id="the-most-pressing-challenges-facing-horticultural-growers-now-and-into-the-future" tabindex="-1">The most pressing challenges facing horticultural growers now and into the future</h3>
<p>The <strong>costs of inputs and more volatile weather</strong> are what I see as the most pressing challenges. I also see challenges <strong>attracting and retaining highly-skilled workers</strong>.</p>
<p>With NZ's weak energy market, the cost of energy is increasing at an unreasonable rate. Supported by Council, our regional wealth holders need to continue to invest in energy self-sufficiency. While businesses themselves will need to continue a shift to electrification.</p>
<p>Attracting and retaining highly-skilled workers is harder and will take longer to address. Some of this goes back to my thoughts on education-to-work pathways. But for attracting the already-highly-skilled to the region, it is a problem of incomes and relative housing affordability associated with the poor supply of housing.</p>
<p><strong>New Zealand's residential property-oriented political economy is a root-cause problem</strong>. I have to believe we can break free from this stifling model at a regional level with Council playing a role as an efficient enabler of increased supply of all housing types. It has worked in other regions.</p>
<p><strong>Real regional wealth can only come from our high-productivity export businesses</strong>, and that requires a steady supply of affordable housing and talented people that can see a good useful life out here.</p>
<h3 id="the-importance-of-irrigation-water-security-to-our-region%E2%80%99s-growers-and-how-to-ensure-a-reliable%2C-cost-effective-irrigation-water-supply-into-the-future" tabindex="-1">The importance of irrigation water security to our region’s growers and how to ensure a reliable, cost-effective irrigation water supply into the future</h3>
<p>Incredibly important. Though this isn't an area where I have enough understanding to form a strong opinion as yet. So as I do, I'll go all-in to understand the problem by taking on the advice of the key stakeholders, experts, and fellow councillors who have this experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Broadly my goal is to press Council to be a conscientious enabler, with an increased risk appetite, while ensuring negative externalities are not passed on to the public.</strong></p>
