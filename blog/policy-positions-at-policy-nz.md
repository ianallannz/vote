## The policies to achieve my three pillars 

You'll probably get sick of hearing me say we can imagine a new abundance, built on place, not things.

**The obvious question is "blah, blah, HOW?**

Fortunately, **<a href="https://policy.nz/2025/gisborne-district-council-tairawhiti-general-ward/policies/climate-change-and-resilience" target="_blank">policy.nz succinctly lays out my policy positions</a>** and the positions of other candidates. 

I really recommend you check it out; there is hopeful, considered, and sharp thinking from several of our candidates. 

There is also a more specific take on my three pillars in **<a href="https://policy.nz/2025/gisborne-district-council-tairawhiti-general-ward/candidates/ian-james-allan" target="_blank">my policy.nz bio</a>**:

1. Restore pride of place using carrots and sticks
2. Join up our leading education, research, environmental and industrial innovations for success
3. Set the right economic incentives for self-sufficiency and sustainable development

Still, best to <a href="https://policy.nz/2025/gisborne-district-council-tairawhiti-general-ward/policies/climate-change-and-resilience" target="_blank">check all the policies</a>, some of which you'll like, some of which you won't, and that's OK.
