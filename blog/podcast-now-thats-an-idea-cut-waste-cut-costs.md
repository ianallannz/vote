## No Council video?

I think I was first out of the gate to film the video, and I mentioned it in a post a few weeks back about <a href="/blog/just-some-motivation/">starting when there's always a reason not to</a>.

I'm not sure what happened to it, maybe lost on the cutting room floor, I'll see if I can find out. But given it was my first nervy outing as a candidate, I'd say it's hardly worth waiting for!
