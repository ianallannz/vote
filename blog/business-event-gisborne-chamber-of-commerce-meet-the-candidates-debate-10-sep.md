## I will be attending the Gisborne Chamber of Commerce Meet the Candidates Debate on 11 September

For all those interested in building fairly distributed regional wealth, this is a neat opportunity to meet me and hear my take on local economic resilience!

The event is a chance for me to introduce myself to members of the business community and share my ideas on how we can grow the regional economy and improve the wellbeing of our people. The night will focus on key topics such as employment, infrastructure, economic resilience, and rates.

**Thursday 11 September, Midway Surf Club, doors open 5pm, with the event kicking off at 5.30pm.**
