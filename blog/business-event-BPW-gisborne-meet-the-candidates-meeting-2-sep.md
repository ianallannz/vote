## I will be attending the Gisborne Business and Professional Women's Meet the Candidates Meeting on 2 September

At the usual BPW club dinner I will have a brief opportunity to introduce why I'm standing for Gisborne District Council; will I see how much I can cram into 1-2min or just set the scene for more?

**Tuesday 2 September, gathering from 5.30pm, with the meeting starting at 6pm.**
