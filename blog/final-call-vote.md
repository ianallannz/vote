## Final Call: Vote like you mean it!

### If you're a grandparent

#### Vote like your grandchildren are watching

Vote for your legacy. For leaving this place better than you found it. 

Vote for a good life in useful work in real industries for our rangatahi. 

This time, **put aside your grumbles**, and find a way to vote with hope for your grandies' future abundance, built on this special place, not things.

### If you're young

#### Vote like you want to stay

Even if you want to leave &mdash; I get it, I did too &mdash; if we do this right, you'll still want to come back some time and live the good life.

If you're still thinking ***what's the point?*** There is a point, <a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/06-10-2025/city-is-made-of-council" target="_blank">this place is made of council</a>&#8599;:

>I don’t know how to tell you this. So many things done by council. Did the water come out of your tap? That’s council. Do you want an apartment? The council decides where apartments can go and **a lot of the time they decide on “nowhere” and “f*ck you”**. Do you like having a huge housing crisis? Councils do those. Do you want to be able to bike without being run over by a truck? Council can make that happen, or more likely, not make that happen and kill you instead.
>
>Seriously there are people in there who literally just say no to everything for an entire term. **Rates rises? No. Service cuts? No. Houses near bus stations? No. Houses on the edge of town? No.** This often goes on for 20 straight years. People keep voting them in. 
>
>**Enough!** I don’t know any other way to say it. So many of your daily problems are caused by council. They get away with it because everyone thinks they’re boring and irrelevant.

### If you're a parent

#### Vote for your children to come back one day

Once, we could pretty safely say **"you'll be back"**. 

But if we keep sh*tting on this place and keeping it under the thumb, then the things we promote &mdash; a cool town with clean beaches, and the slow pace of life with a good job and a decent house with a small mortgage and time for a surf in the morning &mdash; won't live up to the hype.

### Whatever you do

#### Vote!

Like you mean it, because it does mean something, it makes a difference, it really does.

Find those voting forms on the fridge, on the table by the door, or under the pile of bills you don't want to face.

If you don't have voting forms and you're not enrolled, <a href="https://www.gdc.govt.nz/council/2025-elections/vote#heading-2" target="_blank"><strong>you CAN still cast a special vote at a place near you</strong></a>&#8599;.

One more time for the campaign trail:

>Stronger together.  
>**Tātou tātou e.**
