## Just a massive thank you.

If you gave me your vote &mdash; and especially if you're one of the many who gave me your #1 vote &mdash; I'm sorry I couldn't get into the top eight for you.

#### I am just so grateful that you believed in me

From a standing start with no prior profile, you trusted what I had to say, and how I said it, and you got me pretty close to representing you, your children, and your grandchildren.

#### It's a tough message to sell

It's not cool being out there saying our system is making most families poorer and our governments poorer too (*here he goes again!*). Especially when personally you might be one of the lucky ones doing just fine.

Unfortunately the fundamentals aren't changing and I really don't want to bang the same drum in three years time.

**I have hope though.** 

If we accept that the broader system is making things worse &mdash; **if we fall in love with the problem** &mdash; then we can just get on with solving things for ourselves out here. 

>Now is the time to build our own resiliency, build our own self-sufficiency, get our primary industries up the value chain, protect our environment, and support and invest in each other.

#### Now, what's next for '26? God knows.
