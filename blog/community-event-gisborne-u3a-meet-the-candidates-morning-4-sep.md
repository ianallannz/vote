## I will be attending U3A's Meet the Candidates Morning on 4 September

For the large membership of Gisborne U3A, this is a golden opportunity to meet me and hear what I'm thinking on the day at the Gisborne U3A Monthly Gathering!

**Thursday 4 September, mix and mingle from 9.30am, with the formal meeting with me and other candidates from 10am-11.30am.**
