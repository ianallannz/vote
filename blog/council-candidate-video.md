## A centrist midfielder

If you can handle the meander, my council candidate video might give you an idea why I'm giving it a crack: 

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JF0NoWQX0E?si=EUqsAmYV3roUdO3J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

One correction: I mention that EIT is "the only" tertiary institution in the region, that's not what I meant to say.
