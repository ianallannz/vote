      <h2>What am I thinking?</h2>
      <p>I think a lot about a lot of things, but these things are out front...</p>
      <h3>A place worth staying in, a place worth returning to</h3>
      <p><strong>If we're not setting up this place for our children to live energising useful adult lives here, then what is the point in any of this?</strong></p>
      <p>We have incredible people choosing to pursue world-leading education, research, and industrial innovations right here; Mātai, Rāngai, Leaderbrand, EIT, Pultron, Tōnui Collab, Toha, even the Environment Centre to name just a few.</p>
      <p>There is surely an opportunity to realise these leaders and innovators as long-term catalysts for joined-up, well-distributed regional wealth.</p>
      <h3>Pride of place</h3>
      <p>If the above is the long term goal, then what do we do in the shorter term to restore pride of place?</p>
      <p><strong>We may not have the riches yet, but we can live rich lives.</strong></p>
      <p>I'm reminded of the city pride we had when I browse through old copies of the Photo News. Proud of our beaches, proud of our rivers, proud of our streetscapes, proud of each other.</p>
      <p>There are sparks: Kiwa Pools, the surf clubs, skate parks and pump tracks, local sports facilities, farmers market, and busy use of our walkways. But other visible well-trodden areas are sad: our city beaches, our city buildings, our city roads, our cleanliness.</p>
      <p>We must have carrot-stick levers we can pull to incentivise the outcomes we want. Like the conditions of resource consents. We must uphold a social license to operate, whether it's an absentee landlord or a foreign forestry company.</p>
      <h3>Self-sufficiency and resiliency</h3>
      <p>Right now there is very little economic incentive for households to be self-sufficient, efficient and resilient. If anything, investing in doing so makes you feel worse off. Think about water. Pretty sure our farmers have long felt they get a raw deal too.</p>
      <p>A thing I admired about old Green leader Russel Norman was he recognised so clearly that the most effective way of getting society to be resourceful, less wasteful, was to pull on economic levers.</p>
      <p>I have to believe this doesn't kill my campaign... if you want ratepayers to use water well, levy water to reward them. If you want ratepayers to use their land more productively &mdash; e.g., extra accommodation for workers, renters, nan &mdash; rate just the land and levy water and infrastructure load.</p>
      <p><strong>There is an economic formula that sets the right incentives for sustainable development.</strong></p>
      <h3>Other things</h3>
      <p>For other things I'm thinking about, my Diary here will grow as we go.</p>
      <p>And if you've made it this far, it might be worth reading <strong><a href="about/">Why me?</a></strong>.</p>
